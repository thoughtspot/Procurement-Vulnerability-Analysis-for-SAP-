# Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp

This SpotApp was created by a partner, Axis Group, and while it has been verified by ThoughtSpot, it is supported by Axis Group and not by ThoughtSpot Support. 

SpotApps are ThoughtSpot’s out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

The Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp mimics the SAP data model. When you deploy it, ThoughtSpot creates several Worksheets, Answers, and Liveboards, based on your SAP data in your cloud data warehouse.

This is a sample Liveboard, created after you deploy the Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp:
![Sample Liveboard](https://github.com/thoughtspot/Procurement-Vulnerability-Analysis-for-SAP-/assets/102629468/30087229-254f-4023-9ffc-5ecd5c6820c7)

Use the Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp to view products by cost volume and quantity volume to quickly identify where disruptions could occur in your global supply chain, reducing risk and building resilience. View alternate suppliers who provide similar products to diversify your sourcing and establish resilience in your supply chain.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- **Review Required Data**: Examine the required tables and columns for the SpotApp.
- **Ensure Column Compatibility**: Ensure that your columns match the required column type listed in the schema for your SpotApp.
- **Sync Data**: Synchronize all tables and columns from SAP to your cloud data warehouse. ThoughtSpot recommends syncing all tables and columns from SAP to your CDW, including SAP’s out-of-the-box columns or any custom columns you are using.
- **Collaborate on Data Movement**: If you are using an ETL/ELT tool or working with another team in your organization, sync all columns from the tables listed in the SpotApp.
- **Obtain Credentials**: Acquire SYSADMIN privileges to connect to your cloud data warehouse. The cloud data warehouse must contain the data you would like ThoughtSpot to use to create Answers, Liveboards, and Worksheets.
- **Unique Connection Name**: Each new SpotApp connection name must be unique.
- **Administrator Access to SAP**: Maintain administrator access to manage SAP.

Access the following SAP tables and Worksheets in your cloud data warehouse. Refer to Procurement Vulnerability Analysis for SAP SpotApp schema for more details:

- EBAN
- EKET
- EKKO
- EKPO
- LFA1
- MAKT
- MARA
- T005T
- T024
- TCURR

## Run SQL Commands

Execute the following SQL commands in your cloud data warehouse to standardize data types and column names. You may need to modify the code for the SQL requirements of your specific cloud data warehouse.

## Deploy the SpotApp

After you have downloaded the Zip file and verified its contents, follow these steps:

1. Log into your ThoughtSpot instance and create an Embrace connection to all of the relevant views.
2. Import the TML for the Worksheets and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
3. Import the TML for the Liveboards and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
4. You are ready to start searching your data!

For detailed instructions on how to import TML files, refer to the [ThoughtSpot documentation](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/software/latest/tml-import-export-multiple).
